First and foremost I'm not a web developer. I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & javascript but I am currently working as a UXUI designer. I took on this challenge to further enhance my skill set. It took me almost a week to complete this challenge and it is far from perfect but I am happy with it. I referred to a lot of websites & forums because making a responsive webpage is not as easy as it looks. I will continue taking on the challenges and hopefully successfully complete them!
