Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

First and foremost I'm not a web developer. I have basic knowledge about html, css & javascript but I am currenlt working as a UXUI designer. I took on this challenge to further enhance my skillset. It took me almost a week to complete this challenge and it is far from perfect but I am happy with it. I referred to a lot of websites & forums because making a responsive webpage is not as easy as it looks. I will continue taking on the challenges and hopefully I will successfully complete it!
